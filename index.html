                <div class="description description-left paragraph-text">
                    <p>As expected for a large city such as Melbourne, most Airbnb listings are <b>centered around the
                            CBD</b>.
                        The density of listings decreases as the distance away from
                        the CBD increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, this does not apply to pricing of listings. <b>Prices varies from neighbourhood to
                            neighbourhood with no apparent pattern</b>.
                        This could be attributed to the fact that many of Melbourne's most popular tourist destination
                        are far from the CBD and is spread around all of Melbourne.

                    When closely examining different neighbourhoods, <b>Melbourne, Port Phillip and Yarra </b>has the
                    most Airbnb listings.

                <p>
                    For overall offerings, <b>the most popular one is entire home or apartment followed by private room and
                        then shared room</b>.
                    Shared room is significantly less popular than the other two offerings. Despite this, some
                    neighbourhood's room type offering does not follow this overall trend.
                    For neighbourhoods such as <b>Monash, Wyndham and Manningham</b>, private room offerings outweights entire
                    room or apartment offerings.

                        With so many options available, a lot of travellers would look at reviews to determine if a place is worth it.
                        Not only that, some travellers would also be more willing to pay more for a place that has better reviews.
